  abstract = {Increased time spent indoors during the COVID-19 pandemic has made individuals more engaged in personalising their indoor environments and actively participating in related decision-making processes. This decision-making process is influenced by how people perceive spaces as shaped by their knowledge, characteristics, and experiences. This study used mixed-reality technology to explore the dimensions of human perception based on temperament and experience to determine preferred indoor space compositions. Temperament was assessed using the Holland Occupational Themes, Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional (RIASEC) test. Experience was analysed using a theoretical framework incorporating text mining and PageRank centrality. The findings revealed variations in spatial preferences across the RIASEC categories: conventional individuals preferred beige, carpet, and PVC flooring, whereas enterprising individuals favoured marble. This study uniquely examined the human perception system and how individuals form and act on their memories of indoor spaces.}

  abstract = {The person-environment fit theory suggests that indoor office environments should be designed to improve work performance while reflecting worker preferences. However, customising design factors, such as wall colours, wall and floor materials, and ceiling height, is challenging. Although the office type can affect cognitive function and physiological responses, it has received little attention owing to the need for alternative research instruments to implement such changes. Technological advancements in extended reality can help address these challenges. This study investigates the effects of multiple design factors and office types on work performance and physiological responses in a mixed-reality environment. Thirty participants customised their private and open-plan office environments for decision-making. The participants performed the digit span test, jigsaw puzzle test, remote associates test, and MemTrax to assess short – and long-term memory, reasoning, and creativity. The physiological responses of participants, including heart rate (HR) and electroencephalogram (EEG), were also measured. Differences between private and open-plan office environments were analysed using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests after converting the EEG data into mental workload and mental stress indicators and calculating the mean HR. The findings suggest that in open-plan offices, collaboration and task sharing reduce mental workload and enhance creativity and performance. However, a balanced work environment tailored to the task characteristics is essential, as private spaces contribute to higher long-term work performance. These results highlight the importance of designing workspaces that satisfy diverse requirements and tasks. Adopting adaptive and hybrid strategies can enable organisations to enhance productivity while promoting well-being and performance.}

  abstract = {Optimizing workers' mental states has been identified as a key factor in enhancing work performance and achieving workplace benefits. Factors such as office design and work dynamics (i.e. individual vs. collaborative) play a crucial role in influencing workers' mental states and behavior. However, the interplay of these elements is often overlooked. This study introduces a mixed reality approach to investigate the effects of office design and work dynamics on cognitive performance and mental states. The independent variables were defined as preferred and non-preferred indoor spaces, combined with individual and collaborative work dynamics. Four experimental scenarios were created to assess their impact on workers' mental states and cognitive performance. Thirty participants performed individual (memory and executive function) and collaborative (creativity and reasoning) tasks in both preferred and non-preferred spaces. Electroencephalographic and cognitive performance data were collected during the experiments. The findings showed that indoor office design did not significantly influence individual cognition, memory, or executive function. However, creativity and mental stress increased in preferred spaces, while reasoning improved in non-preferred environments. Additionally, individual tasks heightened mental workload, whereas collaborative work increased mental stress. These findings, enabled by the immersive and controlled conditions in mixed reality, highlight the importance of aligning office design according to work dynamics to support performance enhancement and mental well-being. This study demonstrates the potential of mixed reality as a tool to facilitate user experience for workspace research and design in advance.}

  ABSTRACT = {Reliable project management during planning stages of a building project is a meticulous process typically requiring sufficient precedencies. Typical construction duration estimation is based on previous cases of similar projects used to validate construction duration proposals from contractors, plan overall project duration, and set a standard for project success or failure. In cases of high-rise buildings exceeding 200 m, insufficient data commonly arise from the rarity of such projects, leading to a rough estimation of construction duration. Therefore, in this study, oversampling and data augmentation techniques derived from engineering principles, such as parametric optimization and data imbalance problems, are explored for curtain wall construction for high-rise buildings. The study was conducted in two phases. First, oversampling and data augmentation techniques, including Latin Hypercube, optimal Latin Hypercube, simple Monte Carlo, descriptive Monte Carlo, Sobol Monte Carlo, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and SMOTE–Tomek, were applied to 15 raw datasets collected from previous projects. The dataset was split into 8:2 for training and testing, where the mentioned techniques were applied to generate 500 virtual samples from the training data. Second, support vector regression was applied to forecast construction duration, where statistical performance criteria were applied for evaluation. The results showed that SMOTE and SMOTE–Tomek best represented the original dataset based on box plot analysis showcasing data distribution. Moreover, according to statistical performance criteria, it was found that the oversampling techniques improved the prediction performance, where Pearson correlation for linear, polynomial, and RBF increased by 0.611%, 4.232%, and 0.594%, respectively, for the best-performing sampling method. Finally, for the prediction models, probabilistic oversampling methods outperformed other methods according to the statistical performance criteria.}

  ABSTRACT = {This study examines the case of a shopping mall in Seoul, South Korea, based on its offline retail sales data during the period of the enforcement of the COVID-19 pandemic social distancing policy. South Korea implemented strict social distancing, especially in retail categories where people eat out, due to the danger of spreading infectious disease. A total of 55 retail shops’ sales data were analyzed and classified into five categories: fashion, food and beverage (f&b), entertainment, cosmetics and sport. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and exponential smoothing (ETS) models were employed, and the autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) of each retail category’s sales data were analyzed. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used to determine the most suitable forecasting model for each retail category. In this way, the f&b and entertainment retail categories, in which people eat out, were found to have been significantly impacted, with their 2022 sales forecasted to be less than 80% of their 2018 and 2019 sales. The fashion retail category was also significantly impacted, slowly recovering sales in 2022. The cosmetics and sport retail categories were little impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, with their retail sales having already recovered by 2022.}

   abstract = {Though daycare centres are built to facilitate children's social and physical growth, divergent stakeholder perceptions yield conflicts while managing risks for each space due to the minimal guidelines in the Republic of Korea. Due to the unclearly defined knowledge and experience gap between representative stakeholders, teachers have difficulties in operating it with high satisfaction. This study therefore was conducted to systematically identify which parts of performance should be increased to preferentially increase end-user satisfaction in limited resources.This research conducted quantitative analysis gradually. Importance–performance analysis (IPA) grasped the perceptions of construction practitioners and end-users after identifying space composition and representative risks of daycare centres. Based on the factors influencing perception differences, principal component analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM) were conducted to determine which space improves the performance preferentially to increase overall end-user satisfaction.As the utilisation of indoor spaces increases after COVID-19, improvement of indoor spaces except for indoor playroom is necessary, especially, advancement of the quality of teachers' rooms.Outputs by reflecting the end-user experiences support to understand which spaces are managed from the limited resources.Theoretical framework for daycare centre was established in Korea where guidelines were insufficient, and differences in perception of each risk of stakeholders were identified. Moreover, gradual statistical analysis was set to construct end-user-focused centres by extracting where the performance of space should be improved in prior.}

  ABSTRACT = {COVID-19 has forced people to spend more time indoors due to lockdown and social distancing, and clients demand personalized indoor spaces designed to increase individual satisfaction indoors. Consequently, various fourth industrial revolution technologies have been applied to support construction spaces to satisfy those clients lacking architectural knowledge and experience by reflecting individual tendencies and perceptions to build personalized indoor spaces. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how users evaluate the space according to behaviors and emotions felt in the space. A systematic review is performed to integrate significant categories from multiple disciplines to investigate the various decision-making aspects. In this study, 124 papers were selected, applying the PRISMA checklist to conduct a systematic literature review with scientometric analysis to propose a conceptual framework by reflecting the research trend related to indoor space decision-making. Accordingly, research on indoor space decision-making is increasing with pursuing convergence with various fields of study. The research is focused on the following four clusters: indoor space components, human tendencies, technology, and spatial evaluation. The framework proposed by integrating these trends could be utilized by clients as a practical tool to support people-centered indoor space decision-making post-COVID-19. Moreover, a framework should be developed to expand effectiveness in indoor spaces through convergence and collaboration research with psychology, physiology, and the medical field.}

  ABSTRACT = {The recent pandemic era of COVID-19 has shown social adjustment on a global scale in an attempt to reduce contamination. In response, academic studies relating to smart technologies have increased to assist with governmental restrictions such as social distancing. Despite the restrictions, architectural, engineering and construction industries have shown an increase in budget and activity. An investigation of the adjustments made in response to the pandemic through utilizing new technologies, such as the internet of things (IoT) and smart technologies, is necessary to understand the research trends of the new normal. This study should address various sectors, including business, healthcare, architecture, education, tourism and transportation. In this study, a literature review was performed on two web-based, peer-reviewed journal databases, SCOPUS and Web of Science, to identify a trend in research for the pandemic era in various sectors. The results from 123 papers revealed a focused word group of IoT, smart technologies, architecture, building, space and COVID-19. Overlapping knowledges of IoT systems, within the design of a building which was designed for a specific purpose, were discovered. The findings justify the need for a new sub-category within the field of architecture called “smart architecture”. This aims to categorize the knowledge which is required to embed IoT systems in three key architectural topics—planning, design, and construction—for building design with specific purposes, tailored to various sectors.}

  ABSTRACT = {As Korea has declared to realize a net-zero emission by 2050 in the Paris Agreement, the country has begun to implement national energy efficiency policies through the Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design (G-SEED) certification and revision of building insulation thickness standard. However, some studies have reported the ineffectiveness of G-SEED certification and insulation thickness standard in reducing the energy consumption in certain buildings. Therefore, this study investigated the effectiveness of G-SEED certification and the revision of buildings’ insulation thickness standard, and evaluated the energy consumption of courthouse buildings. In addition, this study investigated the total annual energy consumption (electricity, gas, and heating energy) per gross floor area of courthouse buildings located in the central and southern regions of South Korea. Although many studies about the energy consumption analysis of non-residential buildings have been performed previously, a study evaluating the effectiveness of green certification and building insulation thickness standard on the energy consumption of courthouse buildings was performed for the first time. The results revealed that the revision of building insulation thickness standard and G-SEED certification resulted in an energy consumption efficiency of 34.61 and 31.14%, respectively. These results indicated the effectiveness of G-SEED certification and the revision of the building insulation thickness standard for enhancing energy efficiency in Korean courthouse buildings. However, some negative results were observed in the southern area, indicating that it is essential to increase the effectiveness of the building insulation thickness standard and G-SEED certification implementation.}
