  abstract  = {Automated rebar detection is a critical component of intelligent construction, essential for ensuring construction quality, structural safety, and regulatory compliance in reinforced concrete projects. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision technologies in recent years has driven construction monitoring toward data-driven and intelligent approaches, providing new technical pathways for rebar recognition and construction consistency inspection. This study systematically reviews research published between 2015 and 2025, focusing on key applications, fundamental methodologies, and major challenges in automated rebar installation recognition. The review examines deep learning–based visual perception and three-dimensional reconstruction techniques, analyzes the application of semantic reasoning for rebar layout identification and geometric deviation detection, and discusses how recognition results are integrated into Building Information Modeling (BIM) environments and on-site supervision workflows. The findings indicate that most existing studies primarily emphasize improving model accuracy and visual detection performance, while comprehensive automation that integrates perception, semantic understanding, and process feedback remains insufficient. The main challenges include the absence of standardized data formats, limited model interpretability, and weak semantic linkage between recognition outputs and construction processes. Based on a systematic analysis, this study proposes a conceptual framework integrating visual understanding, semantic interpretation, logical reasoning, and field feedback to guide rebar installation recognition toward systematic, interpretable, and intelligent development. Future research should further investigate multimodal data fusion, explainable artificial intelligence, and BIM-integrated automation to achieve high reliability and regulation-oriented intelligent construction.},

  abstract  = {Identifying and translating user requirements into architectural design parameters remains a persistent challenge in building design, particularly regarding emotional user needs that are inherently subjective. While previous research has focused on morphological and functional requirements, emotional requirements remain difficult to quantify and integrate into computational design systems. This study proposes a data-driven affective engineering framework to interpret emotional user requirements during the design revision phase. A single apartment unit was modeled in Autodesk Revit and rendered using Enscape, varying five spatial parameters: ceiling height (2.3 m, 2.7 m), window-to-wall ratio (60 %, 80 %, 100 %), correlated color temperature (2700 K, 4000 K, 6500 K), room color (beige, white, gray), and floor material (wood, marble, tile). From 162 combinations, 36 representative scenes were selected through an orthogonal fractional factorial design with a cyclic-shift method. Two hundred participants evaluated each image across ten affective indices (pleasant, exciting, cozy, bright, open, simple, spacious, attractive, calm, and comfortable). A feedforward neural network (FNN) model trained on these evaluations achieved satisfactory predictive performance. To validate the framework, four new design combinations were tested with ten additional participants; predicted and measured affective indices showed no statistically significant difference. The findings demonstrate that emotional user requirements can be effectively modeled and predicted, providing a foundation for automated architectural design revision based on affective responses. This framework contributes to human-centered design automation by linking subjective user experience with quantifiable spatial parameters through data-driven affective modeling.},

  abstract  = {As people spend the majority of their time indoors, windows have become one of the most important elements connecting occupants with the outside world, shaping indoor environmental quality, and influencing both health and daily experiences. In addition to providing daylight and controlling temperature, windows serve as perceptual interfaces with the outside world. Key design characteristics include window-to-wall ratio, glazing ratio, fenestration, orientation, view composition, and visual openness. The review systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary research across architecture, environmental psychology, and building science to explore how these architectural parameters influence human well-being, mental health, perceptual experiences, and behavioral responses in workplaces and other indoor spaces. Well-designed windows can introduce ample natural light and views of landscapes, thereby enhancing psychological comfort, alleviating negative emotions such as stress and fatigue, and increasing overall satisfaction with indoor spaces. However, the literature also reveals significant inconsistencies across studies, with many relying excessively on subjective self-reports, lacking standardized landscape quality assessment systems, and rarely providing long-term evidence of health impacts. Furthermore, while building type, spatial layout, user characteristics, and cultural or geographic conditions modulate user responses, these situational factors remain understudied. Recent methodological advances offer promising avenues to address these gaps. Immersive virtual simulations, advanced visualization tools, and physiological measurement technologies enable more comprehensive and objective assessments of window design impacts on human health. This review highlights the lack of quantitative measures and emphasizes the need for integrated approaches that combine subjective and objective assessments to better capture how window design affects occupants’ mental health and overall well-being.},

  abstract  = {The efficacy of rebar arrangement inspection is limited by its labor-intensive nature as well as the challenges of conducting comprehensive surveys across large-scale construction sites. These constraints can be addressed by applying various technologies, such as artificial intelligence, image processing, drones, point clouds, and three-dimensional scanning, to reduce the opportunity cost of rebar rework through real-time inspections. However, previous studies have focused on developing technologies for specific inspection targets and have not considered their applications in the complex processes typical of the actual construction industry. This study explored the column rebar placement process to develop a real-time inspection approach that does not disrupt the critical paths. Considering the importance of process sequencing in construction, the business process modeling notation framework was employed to propose a systematic process for real-time rebar arrangement inspection. Finally, the potential benefits of this process were comprehensively outlined, suggesting its ability to improve efficiency, reduce rework, and enhance overall project performance.},

  abstract  = {Conflicts between cooperative associations and contractors are common in reconstruction and redevelopment projects and often lead to project delays, cost overruns, and loss of stakeholder trust. This paper presents a conflict resolution framework grounded in two-level game theory to optimize negotiation outcomes in such projects. Through focus group interviews, this study identified key conflict drivers, including construction cost escalation, contract ambiguities, and communication breakdowns. By modeling stakeholder interactions and estimating win-set dynamics under different scenarios, this study demonstrated how internal consensus and external cooperation jointly shape negotiation success. Applied to real-world cases, this framework demonstrates the practical value of incorporating game-theoretic perspectives into construction negotiations. These findings highlight the importance of internal alignment, transparent cost verification, and third-party facilitation in resolving disputes. This study offers a structured approach to proactive conflict management and provides actionable insights for both policymakers and project managers in complex construction environments.},

While past studies have explored its effects, most have relied on qualitative measures, and few quantitative studies have specified visual quality standards. This study examined the influence of visual fidelity on task performance and mental workload in immersive virtual environments (IVEs). Two environmental models were tested in virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR): a high-visual quality model featuring detailed materials, realistic lighting, and outdoor scenery, and a low-fidelity research model with basic colors, dimensional lighting, and no external views. Sixty participants completed cognitive tasks (digit span, spatial working memory updating, go/no-go), while EEG measured mental workload. The results showed that high-fidelity increased cognitive load in complex tasks, whereas MR environments supported better performance. These findings emphasize the need to balance realism and cognitive demands to optimize virtual experiences.},
